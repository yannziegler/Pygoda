# Pygoda

A Python GUI to visualise and analyse efficiently large sets of geolocated time series.

Developed and maintained by Yann Ziegler @ [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) (UK), [School of Geographical Sciences](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/), [Bristol Glaciology Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/bgc/)

This work is part of the [GlobalMass](https://www.globalmass.eu/) project.

> âœ¨ **Stay tuned!** Pygoda is being tested at the University of Bristol and should be ready for public release in **October/November 2022**. Please _watch_ this GitHub repository (top right button) to get a notification when Pygoda is available.

## Description

Pygoda is a standalone tool to visualise efficiently a large number of time series observed, recorded or computed at different locations on the Earth.

Thus, _Pygoda_ means any of the following, depending on your preference:
- **PY**thon for **G**e**O**reference**D** time series visualisation and **A**nalysis, or
- **Py**thon for **G**e**O**located **D**ata **A**nalysis, or my personal favourite
- **Py**thon for **G**e**O**located time series **D**i**A**gnosis

([yes, I know](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1100))

Some examples of such geolocated data sets include:
- GPS positions at permanent or temporary stations,
- data from weather stations,
- river flow measurements,
- sea level at tide gauges,
- gravimetric measurements,
- ice flux at glaciers,
- air pollution data in cities,
- ...and really any georeferenced time series with any number of components.
