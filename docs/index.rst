Developed and maintained by Yann Ziegler @ `University of Bristol <https://www.bristol.ac.uk/>`_ (UK), `School of Geographical Sciences <https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/>`_, `Bristol Glaciology Centre <https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/bgc/>`_

This work is part of the `GlobalMass project <https://www.globalmass.eu/>`_.

-------------------

Pygoda is a standalone tool to visualise efficiently a large number of time series observed, recorded or computed at different locations on the Earth.

Thus, _Pygoda_ means any of the following, depending on your preference:
- **PY**thon for **G**e**O**reference**D** time series visualisation and **A**nalysis, or
- **Py**thon for **G**e**O**located **D**ata **A**nalysis, or my personal favourite
- **Py**thon for **G**e**O**located time series **D**i**A**gnosis

An API documentation is provided for contributors, though.
